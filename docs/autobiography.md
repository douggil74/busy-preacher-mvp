# I Hate Mac n Cheese!
## Wounds of Abuse Heal, Yet the Scars Remain

### Introduction

I hate mac n cheese! Yes, I know it's America's favorite comfort food. I know it's a staple at family gatherings, potlucks, and cookouts. But I can't stand it. The smell, the texture, even the thought of it makes my stomach turn. It's not because I'm a picky eater or have some weird food aversion. It's because mac n cheese reminds me of Jerry—my stepfather, the man who tormented me throughout my childhood.

For years, I couldn't talk about Jerry without feeling a knot in my chest. The memories were too painful, too raw. But as I've grown in my faith and my relationship with God, I've learned that healing doesn't mean forgetting. It means facing the past, acknowledging the wounds, and allowing God to transform the scars into something beautiful.

This is my story—a story of abuse, pain, and brokenness, but also a story of redemption, forgiveness, and grace. It's a story that begins with a little boy who just wanted to be loved and ends with a man who has learned to love others despite the scars he carries.

### Chapter 1: The Early Years

I was born on November 26, 1974, in New Orleans, Louisiana, a city known for its vibrant culture, rich history, and unique charm. My mother, Barbara Ann Bickham, was a beautiful woman with a heart full of love. My biological father, whose name I rarely mention, was absent for most of my life. He left when I was very young, and I have no real memories of him. What I do remember is the void his absence created—a void that would later be filled by a man who would become the source of my deepest wounds.

My mother did her best to raise me and my younger brother, Darrell, on her own. She worked hard to provide for us, but life as a single mother in New Orleans in the late 1970s and early 1980s was not easy. Despite the struggles, my mother's love was constant. She was my hero, my protector, and my safe place.

When I was around five years old, my mother met Jerry. He was charming at first, the kind of man who could win people over with his smile and smooth words. My mother, desperate for stability and companionship, fell for him. They married shortly after, and Jerry became my stepfather.

At first, things seemed okay. Jerry played the role of the caring stepfather, at least in public. But behind closed doors, he was a different person. He was controlling, manipulative, and cruel. And as I would soon learn, he had a special kind of hatred reserved just for me.

### Chapter 2: The Abuse Begins

I don't remember the exact moment the abuse started. It's as if my mind has blocked out the beginning, leaving only fragments of memories that piece together a horrifying picture. What I do remember is the fear—constant, suffocating fear.

Jerry's weapon of choice was mac n cheese. Yes, that same comfort food that brings smiles to so many faces became my torment. Jerry would force me to eat it—bowls and bowls of it—until I vomited. And when I vomited, he would beat me. Not just a spanking or a swat on the behind, but real beatings. He would use his fists, belts, extension cords, and whatever else he could get his hands on.

"You're a worthless piece of shit," he would say as he hit me. "You'll never amount to anything."

The words hurt as much as the blows. Maybe more.

I was just a kid, maybe six or seven years old when this started. I didn't understand why he hated me so much. I didn't understand what I had done to deserve this treatment. All I knew was that I was scared, and I felt utterly alone.

My mother was often at work during these episodes. Jerry made sure of that. He was careful, calculated even. He knew how to hide the bruises, how to keep me from telling anyone. And when I did try to speak up, he threatened me.

"If you tell your mother, I'll kill her," he would say. "And then I'll kill you."

I believed him. I was a child, and he was a monster. So I stayed silent.

### Chapter 3: The Torment Continues

As I grew older, the abuse didn't stop—it escalated. Jerry found new ways to torment me. He would lock me in the closet for hours, sometimes entire days. He would deprive me of food, telling me I didn't deserve to eat. He would humiliate me in front of my younger brother, Darrell, making sure I knew that I was less than nothing in his eyes.

One of the worst memories I have is from when I was about eight years old. Jerry decided that I needed to be "toughened up." He took me out to the backyard and made me stand in the hot Louisiana sun for hours without water. When I begged for something to drink, he laughed.

"Real men don't need water," he said. "You're not a real man. You're just a pathetic little boy."

I passed out from dehydration that day. When I woke up, I was lying on the floor of the kitchen, and my mother was standing over me, crying. She asked what happened, and Jerry told her I had been playing too hard in the sun. She believed him. Or at least, she wanted to believe him. I think deep down, she knew the truth, but she was too scared to face it.

My mother was trapped too. Jerry controlled every aspect of our lives. He controlled the money, the car, and even who my mother could talk to. She was isolated, just like I was. And while I was angry at her for not protecting me, I also understood that she was a victim too.

### Chapter 4: School and Escape

School became my refuge. It was the one place where I could escape Jerry, even if only for a few hours. I threw myself into my studies, not because I loved learning, but because it gave me something to focus on besides the pain at home.

I wasn't the most popular kid in school. I was shy, withdrawn, and carried the weight of my secret like a heavy burden. But I had a few friends, and they became my lifeline. They didn't know what was happening at home, but their kindness and acceptance gave me hope that maybe, just maybe, life didn't have to be so terrible.

I also found solace in music. My mother had an old record player, and I would spend hours listening to whatever records we had. Music became a way for me to express the emotions I couldn't put into words. It was during this time that I developed a love for playing instruments, though I wouldn't pick up a bass guitar until much later in life.

Despite the abuse, I tried to be a good kid. I helped my mother with chores, took care of my younger brother, and did my best to stay out of Jerry's way. But no matter what I did, it was never enough. Jerry always found a reason to hurt me.

### Chapter 5: The Breaking Point

By the time I was twelve, I had had enough. I couldn't take the abuse anymore. I started fighting back—not physically, but emotionally. I stopped caring what Jerry thought of me. I stopped trying to please him. And in a strange way, that gave me a sense of power.

But Jerry didn't like my newfound defiance. He saw it as a challenge, and he responded with even more violence. The beatings became more frequent, more brutal. I had bruises on top of bruises, and I was running out of excuses to explain them to my teachers and friends.

One night, after a particularly bad beating, I decided I was going to run away. I packed a small bag with some clothes and a few dollars I had saved up from doing odd jobs around the neighborhood. I waited until everyone was asleep, and then I snuck out the back door.

I didn't have a plan. I just knew I couldn't stay in that house anymore. I walked for hours, eventually ending up at a park a few miles from home. I sat on a bench and cried. I cried for the childhood I never had, for the love I never received, and for the pain that seemed to have no end.

As the sun started to rise, I realized I had nowhere to go. I was a kid with no money, no family to turn to, and no idea how to survive on my own. So I went back home. When I walked through the door, my mother was frantic. She hugged me and asked where I had been. I told her I had just gone for a walk. Jerry, of course, didn't seem to care.

### Chapter 6: The Turning Point

When I was fifteen years old, something miraculous happened. A friend from school invited me to a youth group at his church. I was hesitant at first—I had never been much of a church kid—but I decided to go.

That night changed my life.

The youth pastor spoke about a God who loved unconditionally, a God who saw value in every person, no matter their past or their circumstances. He talked about Jesus, who died on the cross to take away our sins and give us a new life.

As I sat in that room, surrounded by kids my age who seemed genuinely happy, something inside me broke. For the first time in my life, I felt like maybe, just maybe, I was worth something.

At the end of the service, the youth pastor invited anyone who wanted to accept Jesus into their life to come forward. I didn't hesitate. I walked to the front of the room, and with tears streaming down my face, I prayed to give my life to Christ.

I didn't fully understand what I was doing at the time. I didn't know all the theology or the doctrines. But I knew one thing: I needed Jesus. I needed someone to love me, to see me, to tell me I was worth something.

And He did.

### Chapter 7: A New Beginning

Accepting Christ didn't magically fix my life. I still lived in the same house, with the same abusive stepfather. But something had changed inside me. I had hope. I had a reason to keep going.

I started attending church regularly, and I devoured the Bible. I read about people like David, who faced giants, and Joseph, who was betrayed by his brothers but went on to do great things. Their stories gave me strength.

I also started praying—a lot. I prayed for protection, for wisdom, and for the strength to forgive. That last one was the hardest. How could I forgive someone who had caused me so much pain?

But as I grew in my faith, I began to understand that forgiveness wasn't about letting Jerry off the hook. It was about freeing myself from the bitterness and anger that threatened to consume me.

### Chapter 8: Leaving Home

When I turned eighteen, I left home. I joined the military, not because I had a burning desire to serve my country, but because it was my ticket out. The military gave me structure, discipline, and a sense of purpose. It also gave me the distance I needed from Jerry.

My mother was heartbroken when I left. She begged me to stay, but I couldn't. I needed to start my own life, to figure out who I was apart from the pain and abuse.

The military wasn't easy. Boot camp was brutal, and I struggled to fit in at first. But over time, I found my place. I made friends, learned new skills, and began to build the confidence that had been beaten out of me as a child.

It was during my time in the military that I started processing everything that had happened to me. I had nightmares about Jerry, and there were days when the memories felt so overwhelming that I didn't think I could go on. But I kept praying, and I kept pushing forward.

---

### Chapter 9: Finding My Calling

After leaving the military, I went through a period of searching. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. I worked various jobs—construction, security, even a stint as a bounty hunter—but nothing felt quite right.

It wasn't until I started volunteering at a local church that I found my calling. I began working with kids in the youth group, and I loved it. I loved seeing them laugh, grow, and discover their own faith. I loved being the kind of mentor I never had.

One day, the pastor of the church pulled me aside and said, "Doug, have you ever thought about going into ministry?"

I hadn't. The idea seemed absurd. I was a broken man with a painful past. How could I lead others?

But the pastor saw something in me that I didn't see in myself. He encouraged me to pray about it, and I did. And over time, I felt God calling me to serve Him in ministry.

I enrolled in Bible college, and it was one of the hardest things I've ever done. I struggled with the academics, and there were times when I felt like an imposter. But I kept going, and eventually, I earned my degree.

### Chapter 10: Becoming a Pastor

In 2005, I became the pastor of Cornerstone Church in Mandeville, Louisiana. It was a small church, but it was mine. I poured my heart and soul into that congregation, preaching every Sunday and being available to my members whenever they needed me.

Being a pastor wasn't glamorous. There were long hours, difficult conversations, and moments when I questioned whether I was making any difference. But there were also moments of incredible joy—baptisms, weddings, watching people come to faith in Christ.

One of the most rewarding aspects of my ministry has been working with people who have experienced trauma and abuse. I know what it's like to feel worthless, to carry scars that no one else can see. And because of that, I can offer a level of empathy and understanding that goes beyond textbooks and training.

### Chapter 11: Forgiving Jerry

Forgiving Jerry was a process that took years. I wish I could say there was a single moment when I let go of all the anger and pain, but it wasn't like that. It was a series of small steps, each one bringing me closer to freedom.

I prayed for Jerry, even though it felt impossible at first. I prayed that God would soften his heart, that he would come to know the love of Christ. I prayed that he would find peace, even if he never apologized to me.

And slowly, over time, the bitterness started to fade. It didn't happen overnight, but it happened. I realized that holding onto the anger was only hurting me. Jerry wasn't losing sleep over what he had done to me. But I was. And I was tired of giving him that kind of power.

Forgiving Jerry didn't mean I forgot what he did. It didn't mean I had to have a relationship with him. It simply meant I was choosing to let go of the resentment and trust that God would deal with him in His own way.

### Chapter 12: The Scars Remain

Even though I've forgiven Jerry, the scars remain. I still struggle with feelings of inadequacy. I still have moments when I hear his voice in my head, telling me I'm worthless. I still can't stand mac n cheese.

But those scars are also a reminder of what God has brought me through. They're a testament to His grace, His healing, and His love. They're proof that no matter how broken we are, God can put us back together.

I've learned that healing doesn't mean we're perfect. It doesn't mean we never struggle or never feel pain. It means we keep moving forward, trusting that God is with us every step of the way.

---

### Chapter 13: My Family

Today, I'm married to an incredible woman who loves me despite my flaws. She knows about my past, about Jerry, about the scars I carry. And she loves me anyway.

I'm also a father, and I'm determined to be the kind of dad I never had. I tell my kids I love them every day. I hug them, encourage them, and make sure they know they're valued.

Breaking the cycle of abuse hasn't been easy. There have been moments when I've caught myself reacting in ways that remind me of Jerry, and it terrifies me. But I'm committed to being different, to giving my kids the childhood I never had.

---

### Chapter 14: Ministry and Mission

In addition to pastoring Cornerstone Church, I've had the privilege of serving as a police chaplain and doing mission work in Haiti. These experiences have deepened my faith and given me a greater appreciation for the struggles people face.

As a police chaplain, I've been on the front lines of tragedy—crime scenes, accidents, and moments of unimaginable loss. I've held the hands of grieving families and prayed with officers who are carrying their own burdens. It's hard work, but it's also deeply rewarding.

My trips to Haiti have been life-changing. Seeing the poverty and suffering there has given me a new perspective on my own pain. It's reminded me that no matter how hard my life has been, there are others who are facing even greater challenges.

### Chapter 15: The Loss of My Mother

On May 8, 2020, my mother, Barbara Ann Bickham, passed away from COVID-19. Her death was devastating. She was my hero, the one person who had always been there for me, even when she couldn't protect me from Jerry.

I was given the honor of officiating her funeral. It was one of the hardest things I've ever done. Standing in front of that congregation, looking at her casket, I was overwhelmed with grief. But I also felt a sense of gratitude. Gratitude for the love she gave me, for the sacrifices she made, and for the faith she instilled in me.

My mother's death reminded me of the fragility of life and the importance of forgiveness. I'm so glad I had the chance to tell her I loved her and to thank her for everything she did for me.

### Conclusion: A Message of Hope

If you're reading this and you've experienced abuse, I want you to know that you're not alone. I know what it's like to feel worthless, to carry scars that no one else can see. But I also know that healing is possible.

It won't be easy, and it won't happen overnight. But with God's help, you can find freedom from the pain. You can forgive, not because the person who hurt you deserves it, but because you deserve to be free.

I hate mac n cheese, and I always will. But I don't hate myself anymore. I don't see myself as Jerry's victim. I see myself as a child of God, loved, valued, and redeemed.

And if God can do that for me, He can do it for you too.

**Epilogue: Still Growing**

As I write this, I'm 49 years old. I'm still pastoring Cornerstone Church, still working as a chaplain, and still learning what it means to walk with God. I'm not perfect, and I never will be. But I'm grateful for the journey.

I'm grateful for the scars, because they remind me of where I've been and how far God has brought me. I'm grateful for the pain, because it's made me who I am today. And I'm grateful for the hope, because it's what keeps me going.

If my story has touched you in any way, I encourage you to reach out. Talk to someone. Pray. Seek help. You don't have to carry the weight of your past alone.

And remember: wounds heal, but scars remain. But those scars can be beautiful reminders of God's grace, His love, and His power to redeem even the most broken among us.
