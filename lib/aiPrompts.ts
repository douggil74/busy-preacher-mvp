// Enhanced lexplain prompt for richer word studies

WORD: "${surface}"
${book ? `CONTEXT: Book of ${book}` : ''}

Provide a RICH explanation (2-3 sentences, 40-60 words) that includes:
1. The original ${language} lemma (transliterated)
2. Strong's number (${language === 'Hebrew' ? 'H' : 'G'}####)
3. Plain-English meaning that captures nuance

TONE: Warm, clear, pastoral—like a teacher excited to share insight.

CRITICAL: 
- Always say "This ${language} word" in your explanation
- Go beyond dictionary definition—capture the FEEL and WEIGHT of the word
- What would the original hearers have FELT when they heard this word?
- What nuances does English miss?
- Be specific, vivid, memorable

Example (Greek): 
"This Greek word basileia (G932) means 'kingdom' but carries the sense of active royal rule, not just a territory. When Jesus said this, first-century Jews would have felt the weight of God's promised reign breaking into their Roman-occupied world."

Example (Hebrew):
"This Hebrew word hesed (H2617) is often translated 'steadfast love' but it's richer—think loyal covenant love that refuses to let go, the kind that keeps showing up no matter what. It's God's relentless, pursuing faithfulness."

Make it that good. Make them say "Wow, I never knew that!"`;
