the most important verse in all Scripture. The Father shows his love in giving his Son for us. This gift speaks to the magnitude of divine love - not merely affection, but sacrificial action. The world here means all of humanity, not just the elect, showing the universal scope of God's redemptive plan.",adamClarke:"For God so loved the world - Such a love as that which induced God to give his only begotten Son to die for the world could not be described in any words less energetic than these. This demonstrates the amazing contrast between the state of man and the grace of God.",albertBarnes:"For God so loved the world - This expresses the reason why God sent his Son. It was love - love that was manifested to an undeserving and rebellious world. The term world here means the whole human race, without distinction of Jew or Gentile. That he gave - Not lent, but gave freely, with no prospect of repayment.",johnGill:"For God so loved the world - The objects of this love are described as the world, which cannot design the whole world, or all the individuals of mankind; for though Christ died for all in some sense, yet not in the sense here intended, which is to save them from perishing and give them everlasting life. The persons intended are the chosen of God, the children that were given to Christ."},"psalm23:1":{matthewHenry:"The Lord is my shepherd - God's people have always looked upon him as their shepherd. He leads, feeds, and protects as a shepherd does his flock. David had himself been a shepherd, and knew both the needs of the sheep and the care of a good shepherd.",adamClarke:"The Lord is my shepherd - There is nothing I can need while under such a shepherd. He knows what pasture is best for me, and he will guide me to it in the proper season.",albertBarnes:"The Lord is my shepherd - The Hebrew word rendered shepherd means to feed, and hence one who feeds a flock. The office was regarded as most honorable, and was often assumed by princes and kings. The idea here is tender, beautiful, and full of consolation.",johnGill:"The Lord is my shepherd - Not only as he is the Creator and Governor of all, but as he is the covenant God of his people. Christ is peculiarly called the Shepherd of the sheep; he is the good, the great, and chief Shepherd, who laid down his life for the sheep."},"romans8:28":{matthewHenry:"All things work together for good - This includes not only positive circumstances but even afflictions and temptations.

Afflictions, persecutions, sickness, losses - all shall be made to contribute to the welfare of the righteous. God has infinite power to control them and direct them to the promotion of his glory and the salvation of his people.",johnGill:"All things work together for good - Not only things that are good, but even those that are evil. Afflictions, temptations, desertions, and all other adverse dispensations of Providence work together for good. They work together in perfect harmony, like the wheels in a machine, all contributing to the same end."},"genesis1:1":{matthewHenry:"In the beginning - That is, in the beginning of time, when God first created all things. The beginning of the creation is the beginning of time itself, for before the creation there was nothing but eternity.",adamClarke:"In the beginning God created - The word Elohim, which we translate God, is the plural of El or Eloah. This plural form is significant, hinting at the Trinity even in the first verse of Scripture.",albertBarnes:"In the beginning - This phrase refers to the commencement of the material universe. Before this beginning there was God alone. The act of creation was the first putting forth of divine energy in the production of physical nature.",johnGill:"In the beginning God created - By the beginning is meant, not the beginning of God, for he has no beginning, but the beginning of time. When the world was made, then time began; and this was now near six thousand years ago.

I can bear all trials, perform all duties, and meet all the responsibilities of my station through Christ who strengthens me.",johnGill:"I can do all things - Both as a Christian and as an apostle.

Not in my own strength, but through the strength which Christ supplies."},"hebrews11:1":{matthewHenry:"Faith is the substance of things hoped for - Faith realizes the blessings of which hope speaks.

It demonstrates to the eye of the mind the reality of things that cannot be discerned by our bodily senses.",adamClarke:"Faith is the substance of things hoped for - Faith is the basis, the foundation on which all our hopes of eternal blessedness are built. The evidence of things not seen - It is that demonstration which we have from God that the spiritual world exists, though we cannot see it with our bodily eyes. Faith is both the evidence and the conviction of the soul concerning spiritual and eternal things.",albertBarnes:"Faith is the substance of things hoped for - Faith gives reality or substance to things that are not seen. It is not a mere hope or opinion, but a firm conviction that what God has promised will certainly come to pass. It makes future things present, and invisible things visible to the mind.",johnGill:"Faith is the substance of things hoped for - By faith we have a present enjoyment of future blessings. Faith gives them substance and reality in the heart before they are actually possessed. The evidence of things not seen - Faith is the eye that sees invisible things, the hand that takes hold of spiritual blessings, the foot that walks in the way of holiness."},"hebrews11:2":{matthewHenry:"For by it the elders obtained a good report - The ancient believers, the patriarchs and prophets, were accepted by God through their faith.

It was by faith that they were approved and accepted.",johnGill:"By it the elders obtained a good report - They had witness borne to them by God concerning their faith and good works flowing from it.

We believe that the visible universe was made by God's invisible power, by His word or command.",adamClarke:"Through faith we understand - By faith we perceive that not only the matter of the universe was created by God, but that it was all modeled into order and beauty by His own hand, so that things which are seen were made from things which do not appear to the eye.",albertBarnes:"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed - We learn from revelation that the universe was formed by the divine command. This is not a matter of philosophical speculation, but of divine testimony received by faith.",johnGill:"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God - Not by the power of our reason, but by divine revelation received by faith, we know that God created all things.

It is kind, ever ready to do good to all, even to those who do not deserve it.",albertBarnes:"Charity suffereth long - Love is patient under injuries and provocations. It endures without complaint. And is kind - It is benevolent, gentle, tender in feeling and in manner. Envieth not - It does not pain at the good of others, nor desire to deprive them of their enjoyments.",johnGill:"Charity suffereth long - It bears all injuries and affronts with patience. It is not easily provoked to anger or resentment. And is kind - It is beneficent, does good to all, shows tenderness and compassion. Charity envieth not - It does not grieve at the prosperity and happiness of others, but rejoices in their welfare."},"1corinthians13:5":{matthewHenry:"Love does not behave unseemly - It is not rude or indecent in conduct.

It seeks not selfish ends, is not irritable, and takes no account of evil done to it.",albertBarnes:"Doth not behave itself unseemly - It is not rude, coarse, or indecorous in behavior. Seeketh not her own - Does not pursue selfish interests, but regards the welfare of others. Is not easily provoked - Is not quick to anger, does not become irritated or exasperated.",johnGill:"Doth not behave itself unseemly - Love acts in a proper, becoming manner in all circumstances. Seeketh not her own - It does not insist on its own rights, but considers the good of others.
